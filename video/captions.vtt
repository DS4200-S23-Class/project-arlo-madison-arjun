For our DS4200 project Madison, Arlo, and 
I, Arjun, decided to create a budgeting

0:00:11.460,0:00:17.820
dashboard to help the NEU Aerospace Club record, 
understand, and plan their budgets and spending.

0:00:18.360,0:00:23.040
We wanted to achieve this by creating 
multi-level visualizations of expenditures

0:00:23.040,0:00:28.380
that will aid budget exploration for 
board members by allowing them to see

0:00:28.380,0:00:33.360
budgeting trends, analyze damages, 
and inform future decision-making.

0:00:39.000,0:00:45.060
This is the view of our webpage it 
contains the motivation behind our projectc

0:00:46.380,0:00:53.760
the data with the data set linked over 
here um and it explains biases in the data

0:00:55.080,0:01:01.920
um if you scroll down you will go to a you'll 
reach our first visualization that shows the cost

0:01:02.820,0:01:09.240
um over the cumulative cost for all 
the different subgroups within redshift

0:01:10.500,0:01:16.620
um over the course of all the semester semesters 
uh I have as you can see the different colors

0:01:16.620,0:01:23.760
denote the different subgroups and the size of 
and the area of the bars show the total cost

0:01:23.760,0:01:31.500
accumulated when you hover over the each bar 
it shows you the subgroup the total recorded

0:01:31.500,0:01:35.880
put and the total recorded purchases and you 
can see these for all the different subgroups

0:01:37.080,0:01:45.000
um board members can get a a more deeper view by 
clicking on a particular bar which will bring up

0:01:45.000,0:01:51.240
our second visualization this shows the itemized 
breakdown of all the costs accumulated for each

0:01:51.240,0:01:57.660
subgroup for uh over the semester so as you can 
see when I hover over the bar here it tells me

0:01:57.660,0:02:03.240
which item it was when it when it was purchased 
what the price was the quantity and the total

0:02:03.240,0:02:10.680
cost importance and vendor and this can be seen 
for all the different items that we purchased

0:02:10.680,0:02:19.140
you can get the same information for avionics 
and you can hover over the bars and see the

0:02:19.140,0:02:27.180
same tool tips again here the the area of the 
bars denotes the total cost of each item um

0:02:29.340,0:02:37.140
um our second our third visualization shows um 
the two line charts or that are again the two

0:02:37.140,0:02:42.120
different colors denote what the proposed 
and the recorded uh budget spending was

0:02:43.380,0:02:48.120
um as you can see there's a legend here that 
shows that the blue didn't is linked to the

0:02:48.120,0:02:54.960
proposed uh spending and the green is the actual 
recorded spending again the lines and the points

0:02:54.960,0:03:03.120
are are marks and you can hover over each point 
to see what was recorded when it was recorded and

0:03:03.120,0:03:10.140
what the total purchases were over here you can 
also see you can hover over these points to see

0:03:10.140,0:03:15.660
which particular subgroup was in which position 
for in terms of the total purchases and these are

0:03:15.660,0:03:23.580
linked to the bar charts here so as I hover over 
the internal Mac points here you can see it being

0:03:23.580,0:03:30.480
highlighted over here and as I go into propulsion 
all the propulsion points are highlighted in the

0:03:30.480,0:03:36.780
graph below so this visualization also allows 
us to see the positions of the spending so for

0:03:36.780,0:03:43.560
example propulsion was pretty high up in summer 
one but it reduced over the following semesters

0:03:44.340,0:03:50.100
um in summer too and fall so this way the 
board members can plan out their budget

0:03:50.700,0:04:01.860
um accordingly um our third visualization shows 
um records when items were broken again here you

0:04:01.860,0:04:08.460
have as you have a tool tip up over each marker 
a tooltip appears that shows what the item was

0:04:08.460,0:04:15.000
the launch date and the amount broken and the cost 
for the amount and again you have marks over here

0:04:15.000,0:04:21.960
uh you have points and you can use the X and Y 
position to to understand what the total cost

0:04:21.960,0:04:29.280
was and when it was incurred this also gives board 
members an idea into when most of these uh access

0:04:29.280,0:04:34.800
damages were happening as you can see there were 
relatively few damages in the beginning of the

0:04:34.800,0:04:45.300
semester but more towards the end so this can 
help them um prepare for the future as well as

0:04:46.320,0:04:52.020
um conduct any analyzes within the group 
to see why these damages were happening

0:04:52.560,0:04:57.600
and lastly we have our acknowledgments 
and this is our the demo of our page
