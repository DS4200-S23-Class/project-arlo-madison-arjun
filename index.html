    <h1> NU Aerospace Club Budget Tracking</h1>

    <div>
        <h2> Motivation: For our project, we decided to build a budgetting dashbaord to help the board of the NU Aerospace Club record and track their spending over a term. As Arlo and Arjun are students interested in finance and Madison has experience creating dashboards and serving on the board of a NU Club, we decided to combine our interests and experiences to improve the budgetting process at NU Aerospace Club. NU Aerospace Club is a Northeastern funded, student-run organization that gives students interested in engineering and aerospace the chance to design and build rockets and planes. Our dashboard aims to provide a multi-level view of all the expenditure done by the club. Our visualizations are intended to faciliatate budget exploration for e-board members and will enable them to compare budgets over time, spending across different teams, as well as, provide an overall view of their available budget. As student-run organization with limited funds, it is important for the club to be able to create a budget plan and monitor how they are tracking to it.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        

        Our <a href="data.xlsx"> data </a> is a manually compiled set of individual expenditure reports from different terms recorded by the members of the club themselves. It contains information regarding purchase costs, importance, and team. An evident bias was noticed in the "importance" data. As these are recorded and proposed by the individual teams who need the particular item, it is rare to see a "Not Necessary" recorded in the data. Additionally, as the club does not spend its entire budget, there may have been some transactions that were not recorded. After the data set was compiled, it was standardized manually to remove inconsistencies in spelling and capitalization.
